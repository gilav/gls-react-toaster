Hello


This is a try to port into typescript the react-toast component made by 'uzochukwueddie' at: https://github.com/uzochukwueddie/react-toast
So first all the credit go to him for the base.

I am quite new to typescript myself so theresult can be non optimal.
My goal is to use a toast like notification in an redux-toolkit app.

The step to attach this toast component to redux-toolkit is still to be done at this time.

Releases:
 - 2020-10-05: V:1.0.0
   - fix few glichh i had with 'uzochukwueddie' code, in particular 'setDismissTime' is not defined. 
   - typescript into

   - add storybook
   - upload at https://www.chromatic.com/apps?accountId=5f7ae1dbff06e6002290bda5
